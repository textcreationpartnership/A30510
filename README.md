Also the Way of Restoration, of Salvation, Redemption, and of Life Eternal, is here declared unto all the Sons and Daughters of Adam in the whole world, that all may come to the knowledge of the Creator, and to have fellowship with him again, from whom all the Children of men are separated in the state of enmity, and are ignorant of him, and drove from his presence.

The Scriptures, and thereby are proved to disagree, and be contrary to all the Ministers of Christ in former Ages; and to agree and concur with all the false Prophets and Deceivers in their call, in their maintenance, and in their doctrines, and conversation, and practice. And being brought to the Bar of Justice, these things are truly charged against them, and legally proved upon them, and their own professed Rule (the Scriptures) have judged them guilty.

1. THE VVofull Cry OF Unjust Persecutions, and grievous Oppressions of the People of God in England, through the Injustice of some of her Rulers, and the Wickedness of Teachers and People, who hasten to fulfil the Measure of their Fore-fathers Cruelty. With a Lamentation over them all who reward the Lord evil for good, and is a Warning to them all for Repentance; shewing that the coming of the Lord is nigh. And this may serve for an Answer in full, to all such who have Persecuted by violence, by Word or Writing the innocent people in scorn called Quakers. With a Short Addition, which shewes unto all, the ground of Persecution, in its first cause, and the enmity which is betwixt the two Seeds is clearly discovered.

And pleading in Righteousness its own Cause, to the understanding of the Simple, against a very great number of Lyes, Slanders, Perverting of the Scriptures, Contradictions, and false Damnable Doctrines, held forth by the INDEPENDANTS. And is a Reply to Iohn Bunion's second Book, called, A Vindication, &c. Wherein what was wanting in his former of fulfilling wickedness is now appeared; by his adding sin unto sin, against God and against his own soul.

1. Many Strong Reasons CONFOUNDED, VVhich would hinder any reasonable man from being a Quaker; And Offences taken out of the way. But particularly, Four and twenty Arguments Overturned and Confuted; put forth, and sent into the World by Richard Baxter, a professed Minister; but a frequent Contender against the Wayes of God. And this is an Answer to a Sheet of his, cried up and down the Streets in London, as some excellent piece; but is proved to be full of Lyes, Slanders, and false Reproaches against an Innocent People. And this is sent forth in the pursuit thereof, that people may not be deceived with every lying Monster which is brought forth to publick view; but first let all things be tryed, and onely that which is good held fast.

1. THE TRUE Christian Religion Again DISCOVERED, After the long and dark Night of Apostacy, which hath overshaddow'd the whole World for many Ages; and the profession and practise thereof witnessed unto by the Scriptures. And here all may see, who it is of all these Sects, and divers Forms of Religion in these Nations, that are agreeable to the Scriptures, in what they profess and Practice, and who it is that are not according thereunto; for the Line of true Judgment it stretched upon all Profession, and a true search into, and tryal thereof is made, and hereby it is manifest who it is, and what sort of people, that may justly claim the benefit of the Protectors Oath, to be protected thereby in their Practices of Religion, who hath bound himself to maintain and uphold that Christian Religion which is according to the Scriptures, &c.

1. A MESSAGE FOR INSTRUCTION, TO All the Rulers, Judges and Magistrates, to whom the Law is Committed: Shewing what Just Government is, and how far the Magistrate's Power reacheth, and what the Sword of Justice is to cut down, and what it is to defend. Whereby they may learn, and be directed to discern betwixt the Guiltless, and the Guilty; and betwixt a Matter of Wilful Wrong by Evil-Doers, which they are to Punish, and a Matter of Conscience, by men that fear God, which they are to be a Praise unto, and not a Terror; and in particular, divers Causes are discover'd, which are prov'd to be Matters of Conscience, and not of Wilful Wrong; though many therefore are unjustly persecuted and afflicted as Evil-Doers. With an Exposition of some parts of the Law; for the Edification of such, as desire to judge Righteously between Man and Man, who would discern of different Causes; and Iustifie the Righteous, and Condemn the Evil-Doer.

And here, by true Testimony, is declar'd to the whole World, how, and wherein, in divers particulars, the Christians through all the World (so called) now are fallen, and gone backward, and revolted from what the true Christians once were. And this sheweth unto all the World, the woful State and Condition, wherein them that are called Christians now stand; being departed and revolted from the Spirit of Christ, and from his Teachings. And this is given forth, that all People may understand concerning the Times, and the changing of Times; and concerning what hath been, what now is, and what suddenly cometh to pass in the Earth.

And hereby Truth is Manifested and Discovered, and the Controversie determined by the Judgment of Truth, between Philip Taverner aforesaid, the Accuser, and Edward Burroughs, Defendant of the Truth, who contends for the Faith of the Gospel, and for the Word of God in the Heart, against all such Gainsayers, as have the Form of Godliness, but deny the Power; and many such are in this Age.

And this is a full Invitation and Challenge to the whole Church of Rome, and the beginning of Controversie with her, for the perfect manifestation of the long hidden Truth; betwixt them that are in the Truth it self, and such as have the Form, but not the Power; that all things may be brought to Light, and true Judgment.

In Opposition to all the False Worship in this Nation, which is Idolatry, which is discover'd in its Foundation, and in its Manifestation, not to be ever commanded of God, or practized by his Apostles and Saints; but it is declar'd to consist chiefly of such things and practices as had their first Beginning and Ordination in the Church of Rome; whereby the Hypocrisie of this Generation doth appear, in denying, and crying against the Papists Idolatries, and yet are found in the practice of the same thing in their Church, Ministry and Worship, which were first instituted by the Pope's Authority.

1. Some False Principles And ERRORS DISCOVERED And REFUTED: 〈…〉Answer to a Catechism-Book, which is said to contain, The Principles of Religion; put forth by a nameless Author: But is supposed to be the work of one Samuel Eaton, a professed Minister of the Gospel, among the Sect of the Independants, in Ch•shire.

1. PERSECUTION IMPEACHED, As a Traytor against God, HIS LAWS and GOVERNMENT; And the CAUSE of the Ancient MARTYRS Vindicated, against the Cruelty inflicted upon them by the Papists in former Dayes.

    _ And First, I shall shew a little concerning the Signification of the Term Phanatick, as of late used; and the first use of it in these late Dayes; and the exchange of the word from one Sort to another; and in whose mouthes it now remains; and who are now so accounted.

    _ Secondly, I shall now shew how maliciously the nameless Author of Semper Iidem hath slandred the Martyres and Sufferers for Righteousness sake in former Ages; and how he hath accused the Protestants (now living) and what effect this would work in England, if the Author's Intent were fulfilled.

    _ Thirdly, I shall now shew how this spirit in the Papists, that burnt the Martyrs, (which is the same spirit that endited Semper Iidem, that is again moving its Countenance now adayes) I shall shew how that spirit was not, nor is of Christ, but of Antichrist and the Devil.

    _ Fourthly, I shall now shew something concerning the Cause of the Publication of Semper Iidem, which the Author saith, is from the late Insurrection in London, and comparing them with their Predecessors, he thought fit to publish the same; as in his Epistle.

    _ Now I come to search some Particulars, which are stated, pag. 3. which its said John Wickliff held; which Doctrines the Author of Semper Iidem seems to say are Errors, by his condemning such for Hereticks as held them for Truths.

    _ And now, last of all, for Conclusion, I have some CONSIDERATIONS to present to the People of ENGLAND, and particularly to the People of LONDON, occasioned by the Publication of Semper Iidem.
